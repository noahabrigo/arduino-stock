The display scrolls color-coded stock, weather, and time.
This project uses finnhub and openweathermap. in order to use this project, you must go
to the respective websites and get access keys. find any spot in the code that says YOUR_FINNHUB_KEY or YOUR_OPENWEATHER_ID 
found near the bottom of this document. Fill in the access keys in the code and
edit the location of the weather and customize your stock preferences.

In the provided files, you will find some wiring diagrams to help you on this project. I hope this helps. Thanks!
